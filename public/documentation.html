    <h1>ParaFlix Developer Instructions</h1>
    <p class="p-description"> ParaFlix is a web application that allows paranormal enthusiasts to access a variety of information about paranormal movies. Users can register an account, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. ParaFlix consists of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API is accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. The CRUD method is used to retrieve data from the database and store that information in a non-relational way.</p>
